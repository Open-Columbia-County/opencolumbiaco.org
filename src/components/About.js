            <h4>What technology to we use?</h4>
            <p>We aren't just using computers or building websites.  We are using our skills to create useful applications or websites that serve a purpose. If we see a need in the community for something we are using our collective skills to do our best to solve this need.  You don't need to be a Developer to help build a website, maybe you are good at finding resources that we can add to that site.</p>
